Using Recursion:

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them.

 
Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …
